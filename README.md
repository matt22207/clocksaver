A simple, easily customizable website, made with raw HTML + CSS + JS trio, that displays an animated clock, similar to the classic [DVD screensaver](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bouncing-dvd-logo).try: [try it out](/index.html).

There are a couple of things you can customize, using URL query parameters:
* `initialColor` - the color of the logo upon loading the website
* `randomizeColor` - specifies if the color of the logo should be randomized after every bounce
* `speed` - a speed in which the logo will move
